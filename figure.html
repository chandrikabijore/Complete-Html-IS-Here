<!--*  IMPORTANT NOTE ON HTML FIGURE TAG  
<!-- *---------------------------------------- -->
<!--
  ? 1: The figure element is particularly useful for images, illustrations, diagrams, videos, audio clips, and other types of media. 

? 2: Use the alt attribute for images within the figure element to provide alternative text for accessibility. 

? 3: The figure element helps improve accessibility and search engine optimization by indicating the content and its context. 

? 4: The figcaption element is used to provide a caption for the content within the figure element. 

? 5: The figure element is not a replacement for the img tag, but it can be used in conjunction with it to provide additional context and structure to your images.

? 6: The figure element is a semantic element that provides a way to group related content together, making it easier to understand and navigate.

? 7: The figure element is not supported in all browsers, so it's important to test your website in multiple browsers to ensure compatibility.

? 8: The figure element is a part of the HTML5 specification, so it's important to use it in conjunction with other HTML5 elements to create a well-structured and semantic website.
 

?ChatGPT: why we have to use figure when we can use img tag ?
*The <figure> tag is used when you want to group an image with its associated caption or other related content, providing semantic meaning and better structure to your HTML. While the <img> tag alone is sufficient for displaying images, the <figure> tag offers several advantages in specific contexts.


? Here are some additional key points about the <figure> tag:

*Self-Contained Content: The content within <figure> is considered independent and can be moved or placed elsewhere without affecting the main content's meaning.

?Flexible Layout: <figure> is block-level by default, so it can easily be styled and positioned using CSS for layout purposes.

*Multiple Elements: Besides images, <figure> can contain other content like charts, diagrams, code snippets, or videos, along with a caption.

?Default Styling: Browsers typically render <figcaption> content in italics, though this can be easily customized with CSS.

*Improves SEO: Proper use of <figure> and <figcaption> can help search engines better understand the content, potentially improving SEO.
