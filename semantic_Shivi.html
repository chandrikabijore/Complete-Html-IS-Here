<!-- ========== Start Interview Questions ========== -->

1). What are semantic tags in HTML?
Ans:Semantic tags are HTML elements that convey meaning about the content they contain, rather than just how it should be displayed. Examples include <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <section>. They improve accessibility, SEO, and code readability by clearly defining the structure of the content.     


2). Why are semantic tags important in HTML5?
Ans:Semantic tags are important because they help browsers, search engines, and assistive technologies (like screen readers) understand the structure and meaning of the web content. This improves accessibility, enhances SEO by making content easier to index, and promotes better code organization and maintainability.


3). Can you list some common semantic tags and their purposes?
Ans:
<header>: Represents the introductory content or navigation links of a section or page.
<nav>: Defines a set of navigation links.
<main>: Indicates the main content of a document, excluding sidebars, footers, etc.
<article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be independently distributed, like a blog post or news article.
<section>: Denotes a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.
<aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the main content, like a sidebar or callout box.
<footer>: Defines the footer of a section or page, typically containing copyright, legal links, or contact information.

4). How does the use of semantic tags affect SEO?
Ans: Semantic tags improve SEO by making the structure of the content clearer to search engines, helping them better understand and index the content. For example, using <article> for a blog post makes it clear to search engines that the content is a standalone piece, while <nav> helps search engines identify navigation menus.

5). What is the difference between <div> and semantic tags like <section>?
Ans: <div> is a non-semantic container that has no meaning about the content it holds, used purely for styling and layout purposes. In contrast, semantic tags like <section> not only group content but also give it meaning and context, which is valuable for accessibility and SEO.

6). Can you use semantic tags inside non-semantic tags like <div>?
Ans: Yes, you can use semantic tags inside non-semantic tags like <div>. For instance, you might wrap a <section> in a <div> for layout purposes, while still benefiting from the semantic meaning provided by the <section> tag.

7). When would you use <section> vs. <article>?
Ans:Use <section> for grouping content under a specific theme or topic within a page, especially when it contains a heading. Use <article> for content that could stand alone or be syndicated, like a blog post, news story, or forum post.

8). Explain the difference between <header> and <head>.
Ans:<head> is used within an HTML document to contain meta-information about the document, such as its title, links to CSS, and scripts. <header>, on the other hand, is a semantic tag used within the body to define the introductory content or a group of navigational links for a section or page.

9). How do semantic tags impact accessibility?
Ans: Semantic tags enhance accessibility by providing assistive technologies with meaningful information about the structure and purpose of content. This helps screen readers navigate and interpret the content more effectively, improving the experience for users with disabilities.

10). What are some potential drawbacks of not using semantic tags?
Ans: Not using semantic tags can lead to poor accessibility, making it harder for screen readers
